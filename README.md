 # Design Patterns Study Guide

 Welcome to the Design Patterns Study Guide in Node.js and TypeScript! This comprehensive repository serves as an interactive learning resource for developers looking to master design patterns in modern JavaScript development. Designed with both beginners and experienced programmers in mind, this guide breaks down 14 essential design patterns—ranging from creational (e.g., Factory, Builder) to structural (e.g., Proxy, Decorator) and behavioral (e.g., Strategy, Middleware)—with practical examples tailored for Node.js and TypeScript environments.

## Key Features:

- Interactive Code Examples: Each pattern includes executable TypeScript and JavaScript code snippets with a live "Run Code" feature to see results instantly.

- Detailed Explanations: In-depth descriptions, advantages, use cases, tips, and notes for applying patterns in real-world Node.js projects.

- Modular Structure: Organized into separate HTML pages for each pattern, linked via a navigable interface, making it easy to explore and learn.

- Educational Focus: Perfect for self-study, coding interviews, or teaching, with practical applications in frameworks like Express.js, NestJS, and more.

- Up-to-Date: Last updated on 11:04 AM EEST, Thursday, September 18, 2025, ensuring relevance with the latest trends.

## Patterns Covered:

- Creational: Factory, Builder, Revealing Constructor, Singleton, Dependency Injection
